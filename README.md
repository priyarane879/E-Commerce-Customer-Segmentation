# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation
This project analyzes a UK retailer's transactional data (2010-2011) to enhance marketing strategies and increase sales. Using K-means clustering, customers are segmented into distinct groups. Classification techniques predict customer preferences, and a recommendation system suggests top-selling products to boost sales.
